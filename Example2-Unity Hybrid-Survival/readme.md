Note: this example has been designed to test the WebGL integration of Svelto.ECS (among the other things). this example uses addressables. You need to build the addressable before to compile the WebGL client if you want to test it.

Note: In order to run the game in a built client (including webgl), you need to build the addressable first using the addressable windows
